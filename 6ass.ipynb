    "                    Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Meaning, it supports different programming approach. One of the popular approach to solve a programming problem is by creating objects. This is known as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). An object has two characteristics: • attributes • behavior Example: Parrot is an object, • name, age, color are attributes • singing, dancing are behavior The concept of OOP in Python focuses on creating reusable code. This concept is also known as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). In Python, the concept of OOP follows some basic principles: Inheritance: A process of using details from a new class without modifying existing class. Encapsulation: Hiding the private details of a class from other objects. Polymorphism: A concept of using common operation in different ways for different data input."

    "                 The advantages of OOP are mentioned below: •OOP provides a clear modular structure for programs. •It is good for defining abstract data types. •Implementation details are hidden from other modules and other modules has a clearly defined interface. •It is easy to maintain and modify existing code as new objects can be created with small differences to existing ones. •objects, methods, instance, message passing, inheritance are some important properties provided by these particular languages •Encapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction are also counts in these fundamentals of programming language. •It implements real life scenario. •In OOP, programmer not only defines data types but also deals with operations applied for data structures."
